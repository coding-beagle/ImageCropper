**This script is a quick and dirty UI tool for cropping images down to a 240x240 bitmap via opencv, pillow, and CTkinter**

Mainly used as a utility tool for my custom pocket watch project, but hey ho it might be useful for another person one day.

Install as an application by downloading the .msi in dist\

Or just download main.py and use it from there.
